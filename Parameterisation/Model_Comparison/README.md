These scripts help to compare assimilation rates calculated by the FvCB and e-Photosynthesis models
- `Calculate_Cc.m` calculates Cc values equivalent to Ca for the FvCB model fit
- `Farq_ePhoto_comparison_new` plots an A/Cc curve for measured average parameters from IRRI data and using Ac and Aj equations from Vcmax_adj_simple and Jmax_adj_simple
