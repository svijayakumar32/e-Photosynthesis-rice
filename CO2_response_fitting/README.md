## Structure

This repository contains code for fitting COâ‚‚ response data with the msuRACiFit package using an R Markdown pipeline (`msuRACiFit_rice_params`) for reproducibility.

All core code is stored in `.R` scripts in the `Scripts/` folder, which are sourced into the main R Markdown document.

> Note: GitHub may have previously misidentified this repository's language due to the use of `.Rmd` files. This has now been corrected via restructuring.

## Running the analysis

Open `main_analysis.Rmd` and knit the file. 
It will automatically load the necessary scripts from the `Scripts/` folder.
