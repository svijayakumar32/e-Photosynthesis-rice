**Structure** 

This repository contains code for fitting COâ‚‚ response data using the `msuRACiFit` package.

The analysis is fully scripted within a single .R file for portability and reproducibility.

All core logic is contained in `msuRACiFit_rice_params.R`, located in the `Scripts/` folder.

**Running the Analysis**

To run the full analysis:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the repository root directory.

3. Run the script using one of the following approaches:

     (a) Modify the setwd() line in `msuRACiFit_rice_params.R` to match your local path to the repository, then run:
     `source("Scripts/x_params.R")`
   
     (b) Alternatively, install the here package using:
     `install.packages("here")`.
   
   Then replace the `setwd()` line with:
   `library(here)`
   and run the script using:
   `source(here("Scripts", "msuRACiFit_rice_params.R"))`.

This allows the script to run from any environment within the directory.
